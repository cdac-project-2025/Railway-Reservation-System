# Railway-Reservation-System

The Railway Ticket Reservation System is a user-friendly web application designed to streamline train bookings and reservations. Built using Spring Boot, it follows RESTful API principles and adheres to solid design principles for modular and maintainable code. Security is ensured through JWT authentication and role-based authorization using Spring Security. The system integrates Node.js with Node Mailer for automated email notifications and uses MySQL with a balance of normalization for data integrity and denormalization for optimized retrieval. The application is containerized with Docker for easy deployment and scalability. Unit testing was performed using JUnit. This project demonstrates proficiency in full-stack development, database optimization, and modern software engineering practices, delivering a robust and efficient solution for railway ticket management.
